1. Progress made in the last week: 
  Brock: Changed from mysqlx to mysql modules. Added some sql interactions and some schema files. 
  Travis: Did documentation work and uploaded it to github. Added a bot to our discord server to allow us to easily have changes to our github documented.

2. Goals for next week: 
  Brock: Adding more SQL interactions
  Travis: Working on the frontend more
